LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell fifo/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/gbi.bi/g7ser_birst.rstbt/gf18e1_inst.sngfifo18e1_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) fifo/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/gbi.bi/v7_bi_fifo.fblk/gextw[1].gnll_fifo.inst_extd/gonep.inst_prim/gf18e1_inst.sngfifo18e1/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
